# To-do-List
A to-do list that allows users to add, remove, and edit their tasks.

This to-do list increases user productivity by helping users prioritize their work and personal tasks; also, it provides a sense of accomplishment when crossing them off the list. In addition, it helps users stay on track by allowing them to set deadlines for each goal.

The MVC architectural pattern is utilized in this web application, which offers a clear separation of logic and increases user readability.
